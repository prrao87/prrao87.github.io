    I'm an AI and data engineer who's passionate about building intelligent, automated applications
    using LLMs and the tools around them. My interests vary over time but largely include data modelling, knowledge graphs,
    Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, data infrastructure and database systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently based in Toronto 🇨🇦, and have previously lived in Vancouver 🇨🇦, London 🇬🇧 and Ann Arbor,
    Michigan 🇺🇸. I love writing technical content and digging into the internals of the various tools and
    frameworks in the AI and data ecosystem, and I'm always dabbling in or building something new in
    Python 🐍 and Rust 🦀. I'm a huge proponent of open source software and open knowledge-sharing, both
    in person and through my writing in this blog.

    I'm a fan of hard sci-fi, and have a soft spot for books that feature space exploration,
    interplanetary travel and other deep physics themes that allow us to dream about the limits of what's possible.
    In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, biking, exploring nature and trying out new coffee places.
