Welcome back to the blog, and hope you like its new skin! I spent most of my spare time over the last
week migrating my blog from [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) to [Astro](https://astro.build/). If you recall, the
earlier version of this blog was built with Zola, a static site generator (SSG) written in Rust. I've been very happy
with Zola over the last year, and even today I'd saythere's absolutely nothing wrong with it.

The purpose of this post is to explain my thoughts on why I rewrote this site in [Astro](https://astro.build/),
a JavaScript-based web framework for content-driven websites. Yes, JavaScript. I used to be very anti-JS in most of my personal projects
because I'd heard it slowed down websites, and in my defence I had a very limited knowledge of the frontend ecosystem in general.
As an AI and machine learning person by training, my world has mostly been in Python (and recently, some Rust).

So why Astro, specifically? For the last one year, I've been working at [KÃ¹zu Inc.](https://kuzudb.com) as an AI engineer, and
I've successfully migrated both the [documentation](https://docs.kuzudb.com/) and the
[blog](https://blog.kuzudb.com/) sites of Kuzu to Astro. The performance of the sites, as well as the ease
of adding custom features made me think of making the switch for this site as well.

## Why Astro?

After nearly a year of using Zola, I was finding that I was needing a lot of manual
effort to add some aesthetics and make my site look better. For example, the way past blog posts were
rendered in my archive was by category, and I wanted to change it to be by year and date instead.
I was finding myself having to write a _lot_ of additional
code to move things around, and even when I did, the aesthetics were lacking compared to other sites I'd seen.

Like it or not, JavaScript (and more recently, TypeScript) are designed from the ground up for the web.
Naturally, the ecosystem around them is _huge_. For almost any requirement,
there's likely a JS/TS framework and package out there that can help you. There are _so many_ existing
templates and themes to leverage without having to start from scratch.

Upon scanning the web for other sites that were built using Astro, I found some of them to be feature-rich and
_beautiful_[^1]. Not that sites built in Zola are ugly by nature -- given enough time and effort (and a ton of CSS skills),
I could have definitely redesigned the Zola version of the blog to look more aesthetically pleasing.
But honestly, who has that kind of time?

Astro provided a great starting point for these reasons:

- Ability to leverage the vast frontend ecosystem and community already building great sites using JS, TS, JSX and Tailwind CSS.
- Huge number of existing & aesthetically pleasing [themes](https://astro.build/themes/) for blog sites
- Component-driven, allowing me to add/remove UI components easily and intuitively
- Easy to leverage LLMs like Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet[^2] and modern IDEs that can help modify the codebase without
the typical frustrations of switching to something totally unfamiliar

Plus, I'd already had prior experience with Astro as part of my job duties at Kuzu, so I was already
familiar enough with the basics of how customization works in Astro.

## Performance considerations

My initial (uninformed) opinion was that my Astro site would be slower than the Zola version because of
the overhead of JavaScript.
However, my ongoing experience managing Kuzu's sites at my day job told me otherwise -- Kuzu's, as well as
most other Astro sites I visited were fast and snappy to load. So I did some more reading to learn more about the
internals of Astro.

Astro is well-known for introducing the [islands architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/),
which is a way to optimize the performance of the website by rendering a majority of the page via fast,
static HTML, and only using "islands" of JavaScript when interactivity or personalization is needed.
This is _perfect_ for the purposes of a blog site, where most of the content is static, and you may
only occasionally need to add dynamic embeds like YouTube videos or X threads.

## Moving on from Zola

I built the previous version of this site with [Zola](/blog/why-zola-matters) in late 2023 because I'd
begun my Rust learning journey earlier that year. With my rudimentary knowledge of
Rust and Zola's templating language, Tera, I was able to customize the [Serene theme](https://github.com/isunjn/serene)
to my liking.

However, after my experience with Astro as part of my job duties at Kuzu, I began finding easier and more aesthetic
ways to do things. The ability to use Tailwind CSS and JSX to build the site, made it easier for me to get a far better looking site
while also adding custom components to enhance my use case.

My experience with Zola was undoubtedly positive, and I'd largely attribute my
inability to customize my Zola theme to skill issues on my part, and not Zola's fault.
I was simply looking for a tool that had a larger developer community whose prior efforts I could
leverage to get a better looking site without me having to burn the midnight oil.

## Choosing a theme

As always the first step in building a static blog site is choosing an appropriate theme. An ideal theme
would contain 90% or more of the features I'd need out of the box, allowing me to customize the remaining 10%
to make the site look the way I want. I found the _perfect_ theme for my needs in
[Astro Pure](https://github.com/cworld1/astro-theme-pure). It had all the pre-built UI components and formatting
features I was looking for, so I didn't have to spend time building them on my own in Astro.

I started by creating a new repo using the Pure theme repo as a template, and began customizing it from there.
I defined my requirements based on my blog writing style, which typically involves me explaining my
thought process on a topic and using a variety of means to illustrate my points.

These are all the components I needed out of the box, provided by the Pure theme:
- Code blocks with custom line highlighting
- Callouts (also known as asides)
- Footnotes
- KaTeX for math equations
- Non-intrusive sidebar with table of contents
- Inbuilt search box to easily locate past posts
- Timelines
- And more!

With all these raw components already available in the Pure theme, I was immediately able to translate
my past blogs written in Zola's templating syntax embedded in Markdown to Astro's MDX format.

## The marvel of developing with LLMs in Cursor

While customizing the theme, my lack of knowledge of TypeScript would normally have been a huge
roadblock. For example, I wanted to disable the comments system (who needs comments on a blog site? I prefer
being reached out to on [X](https://x.com/tech_optimist) anyway). I also wanted to add custom buttons
and a LinkedIn profile on my home page, which weren't in the theme out of the box.

This involved modifying a ton of Astro and TypeScript files, and I'm super glad I had [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
and its faithful sidekicks, Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet, to help me out.

To demonstrate how useful they were, I came across a strange issue where the theme's datetime calculation
was off by a day. When I entered the post's published date in the post's frontmatter as `2023-04-29`, the
theme was rendering it as `April 28, 2023`, which was a day off. I was initially scratching my head as to the source of the problem,
but it took me all of two minutes to get two potential solutions from Claude 3.7 Sonnet via Cursor.

Not knowing a thing about how timezones and datetimes worked in TypeScript, this is the initial question
I asked in Cursor chat to put Claude 3.5 Sonnet to work:

<Image src={Img1} alt="Explaining to Claude 3.5 Sonnet about the datetime issue in the Astro theme" />

The model's response was nuanced, giving me two different ways to fix the issue. I ended up going with the second
approach that sets the default timezone to UTC, because I'd like to preserve the exact date of the blog post's publication.

<Image src={Img2} alt="Claude 3.5 Sonnet suggesting a solution in Cursor's chat interface" />

All in all, I continued addressing my own feature requests, needs and wants this way, and it took me all of 1-2
days of work (among other things) to get the site up and running. Not bad at all! After this, it was
just a matter of migrating the past blog content itself, which was a breeze once I knew how the Astro
components worked.

## Timeline components and more

In Astro, blogs are typically written in `.mdx` files. MDX is a markdown-like syntax that allows you to
incorporate JSX code for custom UI components. This is _extremely_ useful for static blog sites like this one,
where I like to illustrate my points with timelines, callouts, code blocks and more.

Say I want to describe a timeline of key milestones in the history of this blog, I can use the `Timeline`
component that's built into the Pure theme. Once it's defined in Astro, it's just a matter of importing it
in my MDX file followed by the component definition, as shown below. Note that this would have been a lot harder for me in Zola,
where I'd have had to write my own custom component from scratch (because I couldn't find one that fit my needs)
and then mess around with styles to get it to look this good.

```tsx
import { Timeline } from 'astro-pure/user';

<Timeline
  events={[
    {
      date: "2020-04-01",
      content: "Started my journey in building a static blog site using Jekyll"
    },
    {
      date: "2023-04-29",
      content: "Initial \"Hello World\" blog post on thedataquarry.com, powered by Hugo"
    },
    {
      date: "2023-11-30", 
      content: "Revamped this blog site to be powered by Zola, using the Serene theme"
    },
    {
      date: "2025-02-25",
      content: "Another site revamp, this time using Astro and the Pure theme"
    }
  ]}
/>
```

This now embeds the timeline component in the page, and it looks like this:

<Timeline
  events={[
    {
      date: "2020-04-01",
      content: "Started my journey in building a static blog site using Jekyll"
    },
    {
      date: "2023-04-29",
      content: "Initial \"Hello World\" blog post on this site, powered by Hugo"
    },
    {
      date: "2023-11-30", 
      content: "Updated blog site powered by Zola, using the Serene theme"
    },
    {
      date: "2025-02-25",
      content: "Revamp of this site to use Astro Pure theme"
    }
  ]}
/>

Adding callouts or aside box components to emphasize a point was also a breeze. The syntax was a lot more
straightforward in Astro than it was in Zola (where I had to use Tera, a jinja-like templating language).

In Astro, it's expressed using this simple JSX block (much more intuitive and easier on the eyes than
the `{% aside() %} ... {% end %}` block in Zola).

```tsx
<Aside type="caution" title="Here's an example">
  I want to warn you about something.
</Aside>
```

Here's how this would look per this theme:

<Aside type="caution" title="Here's an example">
  I want to warn you about something.
</Aside>

Overall, I found the aesthetics of the Pure theme to already be very pleasing to the eye to begin with, so I didn't
spend any time customizing the CSS. Most of my changes were structural, and the transition to Astro went really smoothly.

Thanks to the widespread usage of Astro in so many amazing sites already out there, it has a large user community
and there are custom components for all sorts of things. I'm sure I'll be able to add even more custom components in the
future as needed, without too much effort.

## Building more with LLMs

With the release of Anthropic's Claude [3.7 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet), it's
amply clear that humans and LLMs are going to become natural pair programmers. Working with Claude 3.7 Sonnet 
has been like having a non-judgmental, infinitely patient, skilled senior developer by my side.
I'm looking forward to working with it to add more advanced features to this site,
such as a subscribe button that allows readers like you to subscribe to the blog and stay updated.

LLMs are truly changing the future of coding, by influencing the way developers like me interface
with editors and codebases. Translating ideas into code and implementations has never been more fun.
Stay tuned for more posts on my experiments with LLMs!

## Conclusions

What began as a personal journey of writing down my learnings eventually led to this blog finding enthusiastic
readers from all over the ð planet! It's been a multi-year journey since I began writing static blogs in
Markdown, in which I've migrated from Jekyll (where I started)
to Hugo, to Zola and now Astro. For me, static sites and self-hosting are always the way to go, because I love the flexibility
they offer in customizing the look and feel of my site.

With my readership having grown over the years, naturally, I wanted to give the site the best look possible while also making
it easier to maintain the site for the longer term. For my writing style, a "minimalist" theme devoid
of any JavaScript would take away from the reading experience. My main goals of writing, as expressed in my
[hello world](/blog/hello-world) post, were to share my learnings, put my work and ideas out there, and
shine a spotlight on open source projects that I like using.

This ties in very well with my using Astro, an MIT licensed open source project to build this site. Astro is very widely adopted,
has a large and enthusiastic user base, and it's really easy to get started with building your own static site using an
existing theme as a baseline. Once you begin, the world's your oyster!

I'm no longer worried about the performance impact of including JavaScript in my site, because of the islands architecture
that's integral to Astro. The static site that's served is not monolithic, so any JavaScript payloads are
loaded separately from the static HTML. Sites built in Astro are _fast_, and there are plenty of comparisons between
Astro and other JavaScript web frameworks you can find online that validate this claim[^3].

I'll still continue supporting the Rust ð¦ ecosystem in other ways by using so many other tools built in Rust, and I
wish the maintainers of Zola well -- in my opinion, it's still one of the best SSGs written in Rust out there.
But for the foreseeable future, I'm very happy continuing to build and maintain this site in Astro.
I hope you can also give it a try for your next static site!

[^2]: Anecdotally speaking, I've found that current LLMs tend to write better TypeScript code than they do Rust code. In this blog's case,
Zola, which uses Tera (a Jinja-like templating language) alongside Rust code, makes it even more niche for LLMs to help out.
In contrast, Astro uses TypeScript, JSX, and Tailwind CSS, which may be new to me, but modern LLMs seem to do well with them.
[^3]: This excellent comparison by [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/astro-vs-next-js/) shows that Astro sites are generally faster than Next.js sites,
although with some nuances. Next.js is a more feature-rich framework than Astro, and Astro is much easier to get started with, is fast, and a perfect fit
for simple blog sites like this one.
